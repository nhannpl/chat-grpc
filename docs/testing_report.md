### 2. Add new gRPC request

# List of all tests for each method:
- To replicate the tests, choose the method you want to run the test and hit the button 'Invoke' (the blue button on the top right corner)
- Examples for the request and response are also included in the code, documentation for those were auto generated by Postman.
